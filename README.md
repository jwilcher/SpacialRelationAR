# Spatial Orientation in Augmented Reality
Spatial Orientation in Augmented Reality (SOAR) is designed to integrate into future Augmented Reality (AR) platforms a basic program for orientation in 3 dimensions (3D) using device data to track;
1. Latitude and Longitude
2. Ground Speed
3. Altitude
4. Bearing
5. Horizon

To do so, SOAR will utilize GPS data and tilt sensors currently available on mobile platforms as a proof of concept, while keeping coding and design in a portable format to be utilized across multiple current and future platforms.
## Getting Started
Project collaboration will be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/) with discussions and questions delivered via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).
## Prerequisites
This program will be designed and written using the Unity development kit with Vuforia SDK bundled. Additional bundle options should include at least Android and iOS support. Unity with Vuforia may be obtained at [Unity-Education](https://store.unity.com/education).
## C#
Coding for scripts used in Unity will be done using the C# language
